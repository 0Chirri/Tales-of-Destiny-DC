<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought you said we
were friends. I thought...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> [ENDBLOCK]
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't expect you to be an adult.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman.
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you want?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me ask you something. Did a kid
give you an instrument once?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman.
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I got an instrument
from a kid on a boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Actually, that
instrument was mine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd like to have it back
if you don't mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman.
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, I used to play
that instrument while I 
was picking up passengers.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman.
[ENDBLOCK]
Then a customer who liked it very
much asked me to give it to him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman.
[ENDBLOCK]
I got it as a gift. I thought
it was okay, so I gave it away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that the guy from Moreau?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
No... from Terazzi, I 
believe.  I think he said
he was here on business.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's getting a little interesting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> [ENDBLOCK
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go to Terazzi. Let's go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems there's been an
incident at that house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, what's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, there's been a bit
of an incident. One of my
soldiers was attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And who did it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, And they've been caught.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong with you?
You don't look so good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmm...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't tell me, <Fayte>. Did
this girl attack a soldier!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
<Sir Fayte>!
I'm not the killer!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> Please believe me too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Surely such a small child. I can't
believe she attacked a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
But then again...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it either.
Such a girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Dear <Johnny>, Please help me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't help you if you
don't help me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, wait. can you
give us a moment?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Forgive me, but I have
to take this girl into custody.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, why don't you ask around
in the Moreau territory?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There might still be people
who know about the case.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
The incident occurred yesterday 
morning. A soldier was attacked 
here in the Moreau territory.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, there have been a
number  of similar incidents
in the past few days.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
The soldier who was attacked
had two scratches on him.
[ENDBLOCK]
soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Based on the testimony of the 
attacked soldier and witnesses.
We arrived at that girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I have an
alibi that I saw the girl at
the time of the incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
I think that's why Master Fayte 
gave you all this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story. Would 
you like to hear a synopsis?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I heard about the death.
But he was playing with the 
cat at the time of the murder.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young man.
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoever's wearing Shiden outfits
here stands out. Besides. He's been
talking to the cat in a big voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
YOUNG MAN.
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you really talk to a cat?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
A girl, right? I was in here shopping
at the time of the incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd been wondering for a long time,
and when I thought he had made up
his mind and wrapped up the goods, 
he said he wanted something else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
I remember it well because it 
happened over and over again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I was at the fish 
market in the harbor. I saw a girl 
who was making a lot of noise.
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
I was kind of curious. I came
straight back to this inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
As soon as I returned, The boy who
was supposed to be at the harbor.
She came out of the house by 
the weapons shop.
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
There are no secret passageways
in this city. There should be no 
such thing as a secret passage. 
It's a wonder, really.
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you find out who did it?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, please go inside and give
<Fayte> a debriefing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay... If you find the culprit.
Please come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Samauri
[ENDBLOCK]
So, do you want to hear
about the case?
Yes
no

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I am.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, for what it's worth.
I'd like to know what your
queen does for a living.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh?	<Chelsea> girl... Do you
want to be a queen?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I don't.  I'm
going to be a queen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, first of all, being a queen
There's a lot more work involved
than meets the eye.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
First of all, when you wake up
in the morning. You have to
change your clothes right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
At least that much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even when we go out.
I can't dress like a hussy..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a bit of a hassle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll have time to
practice every day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I kind of hate .......
But only for a little while.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
The most extreme is ......
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna> [ENDBLOCK
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so busy every day. I'm getting
more and more flustered.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's so ......!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
...... I knew it. I knew it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>... Do you 
not like the queen?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I don't. Seeing my
people happy. I'm proud
to see my people happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I'm very happy to be walking
the same path as my husband.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck to you too, <Chelsea>. Good luck.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I too will be a fine
I'll be your queen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna> Are you the queen
of the Moreau territory?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I am... but a queen
is a lot different than what
you imagine, <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a lot more work involved.
I've got more wrinkles thanks to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>... You're beautiful,
so you'll be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
But you see. They say that
beautiful women have short lives.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if there's anyone out
there who can break this world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll do something.
We'll figure it out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if push comes to shove.
I'll ask for <Johnny>'s help, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. And when you do. You're
gonna have to work me over.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, by the way, how are you,
<Johnny>? How are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
He doesn't tell me how he
really feels. I can't tell if 
he's tired or not.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But why is <Johnny> acting
like such a clown?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's <Mary>.
I'm gonna ask you something
that's hard to hear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, ......, but first we need
to talk about <Fayte>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean <Fayte>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, <Fayte> used to have
a girlfriend named <Eleanor>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can you talk so
matter-of-factly~?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte> and <Johnny> and
<Eleanor> are childhood friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> won't say it, but... 
I think he loved Eleanor.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>... You're beautiful,
so you'll be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
But you see.
They say that beautiful
women only have short
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if there's anyone
out there who can break this world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll do something.
We'll figure it out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if push comes to shove.
I'll ask for <Johnny>'s help, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. And when you do. You're
gonna have to work me over.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, by the way, how are you,
<Johnny>? How are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
In his case, he doesn't
tell me how he really feels.
I can't tell if he's tired or not.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But why is <Johnny> acting
like such a clown?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's <Mary>.
I'm gonna ask you something
that's hard to hear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, ......, but first we need
to talk about <Fayte>. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean <Fayte>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, <Fayte> used to have
a girlfriend named <Eleanor>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can you talk so
matter-of-factly~?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte> and <Johnny> and
<Eleanor> are childhood friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> won't say it, but... 
I think he loved Eleanor.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
But <Eleanor>... <Tiberius>
killed her......
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte> is so much rougher than
he seems now. I can't imagine
what he's going through now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even Johnny, who encouraged
Fayte at that time. <Fayte>
took it hard.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK] <Rihanna>
And in the end, she said, 
"You who have a one-sided love
You'll never understand my pain!"
I said. ......
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, that's not terrible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It must have been very painful for
you too, <Fayte>.I think he understands
that it would hurt <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you're the kind of person
who understands that <Johnny>
will be hurt if you talk like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But I couldn't help but say it,,,
It's because I was in real pain.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
After that incident. <Johnny>
seems to have changed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
She started dressing flamboyantly.
And he's never stepped into 
anyone else's mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte> still regrets it, too.
I'm still regretting it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
So we'll do whatever we
can to help <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's kind of an unexpected
past, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why <Johnny> seems
like such a kind person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You look like a kind person.......
That's kind of a sad way to put it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can change this world.
I wonder if there's anyone 
who can break everything. <x00>
[ENDBLOCK]
