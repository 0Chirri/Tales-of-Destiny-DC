Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh!? Who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, you guys are not
from Cavalese are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll find out
why soon enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Go home! All you damn foreigners
must get out of here right now!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's bad enough that your in my city,
now you're try take Elena away!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, What's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry if we offended you.
But now is not a good time...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
They're the one that
should be apologizing!
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma and Grandpa, stop it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
If these people can't be
here, then what about me...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know what you're talking
about! Do what you want!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, excuse me, but
what was this about...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, half of my blood
is the same as yours.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
My mother's from Calvalese
and my father from Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now I understand, where
are your parents now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
My mother died of an illness
a long time ago. My father is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! I know this is sudden,
but I need a favor from you guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I think my father is still alive
and probably in Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
If you ever see him,
tell him this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell him that his daughter
Elena wants to live with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, yes of course
it's no problem.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sick of it. I hate my
grandfather and grandmother.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
All they say is that anyone who's
not a Calvalese is an enemy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
If he sees someone from Seinegald, 
he'll compare him to my father and vilify him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
He also blames my father for my
mother's death... even though it
wasn't his fault...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Just the fact that I'm related to
those two person makes me sick!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
it's ok, I've heard enough...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I know it's
none of your business.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
If you ever meet my father,
please remember what I told you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
My father's name is Nash.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash……！
おまえ……なぜ現れた!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
お父さん!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena……
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
ねえ、私セインガルドの
お父さんの家で一緒に……
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena……それは出来ない。
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
……え？
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena。私と一緒では、
おまえは不幸になる。
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
何それ？	お父さんも、
お母さんが死んだ理由は自分に
あると思ってるの……？
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
事実そうだ。
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
違うじゃない。
お母さんが死んだのは……
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
セインガルド人の妻となった
事で、あいつの周囲の風当たりが
強くなった……
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
おまえもセインガルド人の私と
一緒にいれば、必ず辛い目に
あう事になる。
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
だから、私もセインガルドへ
行けば……
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
我々、カルビオラ人が行けば、
ここよりも辛い結果になるぞ。
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
おじいちゃん……？
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
すみません、お義父さん。
お義父さんにばかり、ひどい役を
押し付けてしまって。
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
気にするな。
この子のためだ……
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
どういう……事？
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
おまえが幸せになる為には……
おまえは、セインガルド人を
嫌いになる必要があったんだ。
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
だから、今までこんな事を……
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
……それじゃあ、その計画は
失敗だったね。
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
その為に血の繋がった家族を、
嫌いになったら、無意味じゃない。
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena……
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
それに私は、カルビオラ人も
セインガルド人も大好き。
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
……私はおまえを置いて、
この国を離れられなかった。
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
どうにか、今はオベロン社で
働かせてもらっている。
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
まだ一緒には暮らせないが、
たまには会いに来てもいいかな。
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
それは、もちろんよ。
ねえ、あなた。
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
あたり前だ。……義理とは言え
おまえはわしの息子だからな。
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
……ありがとう……ございます。
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
私の方からも遊びに行くよ。
おじいちゃんとおばあちゃんと一緒に。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
俺たちは外に出てようか。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
そうですわね。

Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the mayor of this city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's my mission to rid the
city of all foreigners!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's truly Seinegaldian to enter
a man's home this late at night!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
You have no business here.
Get the hell out of here!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
You're dressed like... a foreigner!
Don't you dare come into my house!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
The truly gifted, the chosen ones,
that's what we Calvalese people are!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
After a thousand years of hard
work, our time has finally come!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you saying that we can't become
inhabitants of the new world...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm not approving of foreigners.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
You can have the lens.
When you're done, get
the hell out of here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
People in this country are poor,
but we all help each other get by.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a virtue of the Calvalese to be
compassionate to their fellow man.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, you'd better
get out of here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
What happened to Seinegald?
What's Belcrant...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Are the rumors of junkland's
disappearance true?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
In fact, it was my husband who was the
most enthusiastic about collecting lens.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
