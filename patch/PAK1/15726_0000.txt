The people of Calvalese live in a harsh<__>environment, don't they?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard it's not easy to move to another<__>country, and it's also a lot of work.<00>

It seems that some people hide the fact<__>that they are from Calvalese.<00>

I hope Baruk's goal is reached and this<__>place becomes a better place to live.<00>
