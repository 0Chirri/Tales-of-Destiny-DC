[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hahaha.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just a housewife's chat...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you. I haven't seen your face
around here, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm from the city of
Cyril in Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, this is
your husband?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, am I !?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, my husband is
in Cyril.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right,
I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, don't worry. What are you
talking about here?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
It's already decided for the aunts'
well-end meeting!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Right now, I'm talking about
General <Dryden>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a little scary, isn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's true that some people
do think that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
But he's a very popular person
in Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That man?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Even though he is a
civilian employee, he is the one
who thinks about safety and
happiness first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a surprising fact. The next
time we meet, We'll make fun of
this story.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Making fun of me, <Mary>...
Are you <Rutee> now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
It's hard to say to our customers,
but we are not currently
cashing lenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, why?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>

Hey, this will run out of Gald.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It's hard to say to our customers,

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, we... that, I have to get
rid of my debt by tomorrow...
do I have to?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you going to do
with the question?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to get rid of our
debt right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Otherwise, there may not
be a tomorrow
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if you say so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I knew that I couldn't cash
it, so please tell me the reason.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
You can see it by going to the
house of General Oberon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>'s House?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...!

I wish <Lion> could beat
all the bad guys.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I went to the castle and left the
lens. I was also helpful, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Lion>? I was just
talking about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you <Lion>? Wow, you're
a beautiful guy even up close!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>! I heard you've achieved
your great mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh my, I can't believe you're
talking to me <Lion>. You're
really a cutie you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw the rumored <Lion> the other day.
He's such a pretty boy, I'm in love with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard a rumor from a soldier that <Lion>
has fulfilled another great mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen <Lion> lately, I wonder 
if he's gone somewhere far away.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> where have you run off
to at such a terrible time?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
There are rumors that <Lion> was
a bad guy, but I don't believe them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Make a hole in that
damn outer shell!

Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you dare lose!

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> I hope you'll rise to the occasion.
It's not the era of the Seven Generals anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll dry

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The voice that came from the sky,
it sounded familiar somehow?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that it was Oberon's CEO
who was broadcasting from the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what will happen
to Seinegald now...

俺、頭あまり良くないせいか、
聞きわけも悪いんだ。
[ENDBLOCK]

いや……

[ENDBLOCK]
そうか……わかったぞ。
リーネの事をあまり考えなかった理由。
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
俺にとってはリーネも、それ以外も……
全部ひっくるめて、大切だからだ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
俺……やっぱり守りたいよ。

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>、おまえの本当の気持ちを、
聞かせてくれ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
軍人としての判断じゃなくて。
おまえ自身が、どう思っているかだ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
それは……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
おまえは剣の形をしてるけど、
中身は俺たちと同じ、人間だろ？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
……！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
そんなおまえは、
この状況をどうしたいんだ？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
……言うまでもないだろう。
なんとかしたいに決まっている！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
千年前、苦労して取り戻した大地を、
みすみす奪われてなるものか！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
だったら！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
だったら、一緒に考えよう。
やれる事は、全部やってやろう。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
俺が頼りにならないんだったら、
もっと鍛えてくれよ。遠慮するな！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
俺は元のマスターだった、
おまえ自身に近づきたい。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
おまえと本当の意味で協力し合い、
この世界を守る方法を、見つけたいんだ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
