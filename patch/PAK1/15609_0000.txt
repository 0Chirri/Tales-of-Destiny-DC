The Draconis was attacked by monsters?<__>That's an unusual thing to happen.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though the lens has made them more violent,<__>those monsters were once ordinary wild animals.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Their instincts wouldn't let them confront<__>an entity as intimidating as<__>the Draconis.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's like they're being controlled<__>by a beastmaster...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's possible someone forced them to do it.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
But I've never heard of anyone who<__>could achieve such a thing.<00>
