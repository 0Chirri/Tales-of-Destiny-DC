Master <Lion>, please remind me.<__>What kind of place is Harmentz, again?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Last time I was there, it seemed like a<__>quiet village with only children and the elderly.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then, why would your sister go to a<__>place in the countryside like that?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good question...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe she wanted to sell off her stolen goods<__>but was instead reported.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's usually how it goes, isn't it?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, I get it. You're as sharp<__>as always, Young Master!<0_0>
